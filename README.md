# C++ Problem Practice Repository

Welcome to the C++ Problem Practice Repository! This repository is dedicated to helping programmers improve their problem-solving skills and master C++ through hands-on coding challenges.

## üìö About This Repository

- **Comprehensive Collection:** Contains a wide range of C++ solutions to problems from online judges (like LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, etc.) and other competitive programming platforms.
- **Skill Development:** Focuses on algorithms, data structures, and coding techniques essential for interviews and competitions.
- **Well-Organized:** Each file is named after the problem it solves, making it easy to browse and locate specific solutions.

## üí° Topics Covered

This repository includes solutions related to a variety of topics, including but not limited to:

- **Arrays and Strings:** Manipulation, searching, sorting, and other common operations.
- **Linked Lists:** Singly, doubly, circular linked lists, and related problems.
- **Trees and Graphs:** Traversal, searching, shortest path, and other graph algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Optimization problems, memoization, and tabulation techniques.
- **Sorting and Searching:** Efficient algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, binary search.
- **Greedy Algorithms:** Problems solvable by making locally optimal choices.
- **Bit Manipulation:** Operations on binary representations of numbers.
- **Recursion and Backtracking:** Problems involving exhaustive search and recursive solutions.
- **Data Structures:** Stacks, queues, heaps, hash tables, tries, etc.
- **Mathematics:** Number theory, combinatorics, and mathematical algorithms.

## Getting Started

1. **Browse Solutions:**
   - Explore the repository to find solutions to various problems. Each `.cpp` file contains a self-contained solution with comments for clarity.
2. **Compile a Solution:**
   - Use any C++ compiler (e.g., g++). Example command in PowerShell:

     ```powershell
     g++ your_problem_file.cpp -o output_executable_name.exe
     ```

3. **Run Executables:**
   - On Windows, you can run the generated `.exe` files directly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Basic knowledge of C++ and command-line usage
